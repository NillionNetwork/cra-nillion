# Nillion Operations and Blind Compute Demo with Keplr Wallet connection

This is a demo of the JavaScript Nillion Client working with payments connected to the testnet.

Notes

- This uses a proxy /nilchain-proxy set up in the webpack that targets the json rpc from your .env file
- A Nillion config is in the nillion.ts file. This config reads environment variables from your .env file, which can either point to Testnet or nillion-devnet values

## Run nillion-devnet

Install the `nightly-v2024-06-27-7db213f55` version of nillion-devnet to pull updated SDK tools including the latest nillion-devnet.

```
nilup install nightly-v2024-06-27-7db213f55
nilup use nightly-v2024-06-27-7db213f55
```

Run the devnet using any seed (the example uses "my-seed") so the cluster id, websockets, and other environment variables stay constant even when you restart nillion-devnet.

```shell
nillion-devnet --seed my-seed
```

You will see an output like this:

```
nillion-devnet --seed my-seed

üåÑ environment file written to /Users/steph/Library/Application Support/nillion.nillion/nillion-devnet.env
```

Copy the path printed after "üåÑ environment file written to" and open the file

```
vim "/Users/steph/Library/Application Support/nillion.nillion/nillion-devnet.env"
```

This file has the nillion-devnet generated values for cluster id, websocket, json rpc, and private key. You'll need to put these in your local .env in one of the next steps so that your cra-nillion demo app connects to the nillion-devnet.

## Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/NillionNetwork/cra-nillion.git
cd cra-nillion
```

Copy the up the .env.example file to a new .env and set up these variables to match the nillion environment file

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Update your newly created .env with environment variables outout in your terminal by nillion-devnet

```
# replace with values from nillion-testnet

REACT_APP_NILLION_BOOTNODE_WEBSOCKET=
REACT_APP_NILLION_NILCHAIN_JSON_RPC=

REACT_APP_NILLION_NILCHAIN_CHAIN_ID=nillion-chain-testnet-1

```

Install dependencies and start the demo project. Notice that a local nillion_js_client.tgz is installed rather than a version of the JavaScript Client from npm. This version includes payments.

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
