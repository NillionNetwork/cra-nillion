## Run nillion-devnet

Install the very latest version of nillion-devnet. Run the devnet

```shell
nillion-devnet
```

You will see an output like this:

```

📝 nillion CLI configuration written to /Users/steph/Library/Application Support/nillion.nillion/config.yaml
🌄 environment file written to /Users/steph/Library/Application Support/nillion.nillion/nillion-devnet.env
```

Copy the path that the nillion environment file was written to and open the file

```
vim "/Users/steph/Library/Application Support/nillion.nillion/nillion-devnet.env"
```

## Clone this repo

```
git clone [repo]
cd [repo]
```

Copy the up the .env.example file to a new .env and set up these variables to match the nillion environment file

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Install dependencies and start the demo project. Notice that a local nillion_js_client.tgz is installed rather than a version of the JavaScript Client from npm. This version includes payments.

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
